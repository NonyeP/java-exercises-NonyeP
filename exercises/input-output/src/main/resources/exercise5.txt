My brothers in arms
You did not desert me
In the fear and alarm
And though they did hurt me so bad
As the battle raged high
I've witnessed your suffering
Baptisms of fire
Through these fields of destruction

Brothers in arms
And you'll no longer burn to be
Your valleys and your farms
Someday you'll return to
And always will be
But my home is the lowlands
Are a home now for me
These mist covered mountains
